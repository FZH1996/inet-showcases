Infrastructure
--------------

what is this about?

- how to configure it
- how to check if it is configured properly

In the real world, 802.11 devices can operate in infrastructure mode and adhoc mode
Infrastructure mode, where wireless networks are created by access points and hosts connect
to that
Adhoc mode where wireless hosts can create an adhoc network in the absence of any network
infrastructure

In infrastructure mode, the access point provides services such as internet access

Is it possible to relay packets in adhoc mode ?

it is not part of 802.11

if the routes are configured properly, it can be done.

by default, i think they are on the same subnet, and assume all nodes are directly reachable

i think


This showcase is about how to configure the infrastructure mode and adhoc mode (and how to check if it
is configured properly)
